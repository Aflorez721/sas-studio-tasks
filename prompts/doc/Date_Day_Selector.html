<h1>
Date Day Selector Task
</h1> 
The date day selector task displays an Options tab containing a combo box.  The choices in the combobox are:
<ul>
<li>Select date - a date selector appears 
<li>Today 
<li>Tomorrow
<li>Yesterday
<li>Current data of last year
<li>Current day of next year
<li>Current day of last month
<li>Current day of next month
<li>N days ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N days from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
</ul>

When a selection made and values are specified in any dependent controls the following macro variables are created and set as follows:
<ul>
<li>dataday - the date selected or a function that calculates the value of the selection, formatted as DDMMMYYYY
<li>dateday_rel - a code that represents the selection made 
<li>dateday_label - the common name of the selection 
</ul>
<p>
An example of the code generated by this task when "N days from now" is selected and a value of 9 is specified for "Number of days":
<p>
<pre>
%global dateday;
%global dateday_rel;
%global dateday_label;
%let dateday = %sysfunc(intnx(Day, %sysfunc(date()), +9, s), DATE9.);
%let dateday_label = 9 days from now;
%let dateday_rel = D9D;
%put _GLOBAL_;
</pre>
<p>
The macro variable values set by this example code are as follows if today is March 21, 2017:
<p>
<pre>
GLOBAL DATEDAY 30MAR2017
GLOBAL DATEDAY_LABEL 9 days from now
GLOBAL DATEDAY_REL D9D
</pre>
