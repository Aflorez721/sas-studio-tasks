<h1>
Color Selector Task
</h1> 
The color selector task displays an Option tab with a color selector.   When a color is selected a global macro variable called "color" is created and set to the hex value of the color selected.   
<p>
An example of the generated code is: 
<p>
<pre>
%global color;
%let color=cx00ffff;
%put _GLOBAL_;
</pre>
