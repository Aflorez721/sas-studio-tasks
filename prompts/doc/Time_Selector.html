Time Selector Task
</h1> 
The time selector task displays an Options tab containing a combo box.  The choices in the combobox are:
<ul>
<li>Specify time - an input field prompting for a time appears
<li>Current hour 
<li>Previous hour
<li>Next hour
<li>Current minute
<li>Next minute
<li>Previous minute
<li>N minutes ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N minutes from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N hours ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N hours from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
</ul>

When a selection made and values are specified in any dependent controls the following macro variables are created and set as follows:
<ul>
<li>time - the time specified or a function that calculates the value of the selection, formatted as HH:MM:SS
<li>time_rel - a code that represents the selection made 
<li>time_label - the common name of the selection 
</ul>
<p>
An example of the code generated by this task when "Current time" is selected:
<p>
<pre>
%global time;
%global time_rel;
%global time_label;
%let time = %sysfunc(time(), time8.0);
%let time_label = Current time;
%let time_rel = t0m;
</pre>
<p>
The macro variable values set by this example code are as follows if it is 11:27:27 AM.
<p>
<pre>
 GLOBAL TIME 11:27:27
 GLOBAL TIME_LABEL Current time
 GLOBAL TIME_REL t0m
</pre>
