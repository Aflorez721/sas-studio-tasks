<h1>
Date Quarter Selector Task
</h1> 
The date quarter selector task displays an Options tab containing a combo box.  The choices in the combobox are:
<ul>
<li>Select quarter - a quarter combobox and year input field are shown
<li>Current quarter
<li>Previous quarter
<li>Next quarter
<li>Current quarter of previous year
<li>Current quarter of next year
<li>N quarters ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N quarters from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
</ul>

When a selection made and values are specified in any dependent controls the following macro variables are created and set as follows:
<ul>
<li>quarter - the first day of the quarter selected or a function that calculates the first day of the quarter of the selection formatted as DDMMMYYYY
<li>quarter_end - the first last of the quarter selected or a function that calculates the first day of the quarter of the selection formatted as DDMMMYYYY
<li>quarter_rel - a code that represents the selection made 
<li>quarter_label - the common name of the selection 
</ul>
<p>
An example of the code generated by this task when "Next Quarter" is selected:
<p>
<pre>
%global quarter;
%global quarter_end;
%global quarter_rel;
%global quarter_label;
%let quarter = %sysfunc(intnx(Quarter, %sysfunc(date()), 1, b), DATE9.);
%let quarter_end = %sysfunc(intnx(Quarter, %sysfunc(date()), 1, e), DATE9.);
%let quarter_label = Next Quarter;
%let quarter_rel = Q1Q;
%put _GLOBAL_;
</pre>
<p>
The macro variable values set by this example code, if the current quarter is the first quarter of 2017, are:
<p>
<pre>
 GLOBAL QUARTER 01APR2017
 GLOBAL QUARTER_END 30JUN2017
 GLOBAL QUARTER_LABEL Next Quarter
 GLOBAL QUARTER_REL Q1Q
</pre>
