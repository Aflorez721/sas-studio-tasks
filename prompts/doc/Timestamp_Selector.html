<h1>
Timestamp Selector Task
</h1> 
The timestamp selector task displays an Options tab containing a combo box.  The choices in the combobox are:
<ul>
<li>Specify timestamp - an input field prompting for a timestamp appears
<li>Current date and time 
<li>Current date and time previous year
<li>Current date and time next year
<li>Current hour
<li>Next hour
<li>Previous hour
<li>Current minute
<li>Next minute
<li>Previous minute
<li>N minutes ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N minutes from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N hours ago - an input field prompts for an integer 
<li>N hours from now - an input field prompts for an integer 
</ul>

When a selection made and values are specified in any dependent controls the following macro variables are created and set as follows:
<ul>
<li>timestamp - the timestamp specified or a function that calculates the value of the selection, formatted as DDMMMYYYY HH:MM:SS
<li>timestamp_rel - a code that represents the selection made 
<li>timestamp_label - the common name of the selection 
</ul>
<p>
An example of the code generated by this task when "Current date and time" is selected:
<p>
<pre>
%global timestamp;
%global timestamp_rel;
%global timestamp_label;
%let timestamp = %sysfunc(datetime(), DATETIME20.);
%let timestamp = %sysfunc(catx(%str( ), %substr(&timestamp, 1, 9), 
	%substr(&timestamp, 11, 8)));
%let timestamp_label = Current date and time;
%let timestamp_rel = T0m;
%put _GLOBAL_;
</pre>
<p>
The macro variable values set by this example code are as follows if it is March 22, 2017 at 11:27:27 AM.
<p>
<pre>
 GLOBAL TIMESTAMP 22MAR2017 11:33:03
 GLOBAL TIMESTAMP_LABEL Current date and time
 GLOBAL TIMESTAMP_REL T0m
</pre>
